# Clarify 📖✨

Clarify is a web application rapidly prototyped at **Hackabull 2025** (a 24-hour hackathon) 🚀 to enhance reading accessibility and comprehension for individuals with dyslexia and ADHD. It provides a suite of tools to customize the presentation of digital text, making reading a more comfortable and effective experience.

## 🛠️ Core Functionalities

Clarify empowers users to tailor their reading environment with features such as:

* ↔️ **Adjustable Line Spacing:** Increase or decrease the space between lines of text for improved readability.
* 🅰️ **Dyslexia-Friendly Fonts:** Select from a range of fonts specifically designed to aid readability for users with dyslexia.
* ✂️ **Text Segmentation:** Break down large passages of text into smaller, more digestible chunks, reducing cognitive load.
* 📥 **Versatile Content Input:**
    * 📄 Upload **PDF** documents.
    * 📑 Import **Word documents** (.doc, .docx).
    * 🖼️ Extract text from **images** using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
    * ✍️ Paste text directly into the application.

## 💻 Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Built with **React.js** ⚛️ (ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface).
* **Backend & Database:** Powered by **Supabase** ☁️ (managing data storage and backend logic).
